To Do:
1. Do not allow redirection to edit and delete form (URI), if user does not own the selected listing




Issues:
1. App\Http\Controllers\ListingController
-> In manage() method, VSCode detects listings() as a non-existing method in ListingController, though it is defined in Listing Model and works in run time
